*TODO: provide a UI to search for and display upcoming spaceflight events*

[David Lazar](mailto:me@davidlazar.co)

## Proposed Solution

*TODO:*
- Used create-react-app to create the project
- Using the bare bone method done the basic structure of the project and flow of the data
- Created base components to be used
- Created the types Utils based on the api responses
- Created the missions API client file in order to keep our API calls separate for cleaner components
- Used 2 different 'views' components one for the main page and one for the single event view
- Basic styling of the components using styled-components
